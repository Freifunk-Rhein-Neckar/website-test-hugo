This Site is build with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

## Local Server

Hugo comes with an integrated WebServer. You can start it with `hugo server`. 
It will start an webserver on localhost and automatically reload the page when you save your changes.

## Build

Install hugo and type `hugo`. You now find the site under `public/`.

## Deployment

The master branch is automatically deployed when changes are made. 
So just push your changes to the master branch and the CI
will take care of the rest.
